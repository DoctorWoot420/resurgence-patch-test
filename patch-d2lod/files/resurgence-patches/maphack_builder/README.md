This repo is to manage ongoing tweaks to the resurgence bh configuration.  We'll cut releases from here and manually push the complete files into the patch serer repo to deploy to launcher.



Just some scratch notes for now:




Overview of notify-dead and progressively filtering items
* Many times you want an item to ping early on, but get completely filteted out eventually.  This is possible with multiple lines, but each line must work with eachother.
* When an error occurs, you'll see [blocked] in the item names.  This means a line matched the item somewhere in the file, and then it was filtered out by another line after.
* notify-dead means "show this item, but not on the map"

You have 3 choices for progressively filtering items:
* Tier only: good for high tier items that never filter
* Tier + notify-dead: use this combo when an item should ping at first, then drop to map-only after a tier, but never get filtered
* Tier + notify-dead + filter line (blank item name output): use this combo to have something progress from a pingable item, to map-only, to eventually getting filtered out.

Unless something should be visibile at filter 3, it must have a notify-dead and/or a filter line, if it also has a tier line somewhere.
You don't have to define a filter line for every tiered line because there are catch-all filters on bottom.  For any rare/craft/alch lines that you want to filter, you only need to specify the FILTLVL<X criteria on the target lines.  Just make that your criteria is the filter level below what that item would get filtered at below.  For example elite rare items dont get filtered until FILT 3 at bottom, so a rare line to highlight them would be like (ulb) (RARE) (FILTLVL<3) (otherCriteriaHere), then you can count on it matching the generic filter line once it hits filt 3.
